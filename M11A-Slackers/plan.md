# Plan
##### Iteration 2


### Workload splitting
Each team member will be responsible for the implementation of several functions. Functions will be split similarly to the tests, such that each person is responsible for eight of the functions. Slight changes have been made so that categories are not unnecessarily split between people. Some functions may be tied in with each other in such a way that it would be beneficial for them to be written by the same person. This will be discussed during week 1, either early via Messenger or during the meeting.

Since the frontend is being created seperately, each member's ability to test their functions should not be too dependent on any other member finishing a specific task first. Again this will be discussed before the end of Thursday week 1, so as not to slow down the progress of any member.

More difficult functions such as `search()` may require collaboration. This will be discussed during the week 1 and 2 meetings, after the function implementation has been brainstormed individually.

### Weekly meetings
Our group will meet on a weekly basis, on Thursday at 2:00pm unless specified otherwise. If any member is unable to attend this meeting, they should send a message via Facebook Messenger (see below) as early as possible, so that we can reschedule if feasible, or expect to have to get them the information in another way. The meetings will be held at the UNSW library.

---

### Organisation outside of meetings
Our group will use two seperate group chats - a Facebook Messenger group for the purpose of quick updates, clarifications, etc. and a Discord channel for sharing large amounts of information relating to programming. Any online meetings, should they become necessary, will also be held on this Discord.
