# Reflection
###### Iteration 1

Although our group did well this iteration, there are several areas that could have been improved. In particular, our time management skills, and ability to organise things in advance have room for improvement moving into iteration two.

For the pytests, our group chose to split the workload by assigning each member one quarter of the total functions, or eight each. We agreed to have the tests done by midweek, to allow time for the rest of the tasks. This was a good method of splitting work, and overall did not feel significantly imbalanced or rushed. However, we did not discuss formatting of our testing documents in advance. Though we were able to resolve these formatting conflicts fairly quickly and without any contention, it ended up leaving us with a fair amount of extra work to do standardising the tests, which could have been avoided. 

Our approach to the user stories was to each watch the specification video, and then contribute to the board until we had collectively gone through every feature we could think of. This worked well, got the task done fairly quickly, and split the workload evenly. 

The planning and testing documents were left until last out of all of the tasks. The intention of this was to get the more significant aspects such as testing out of the way first, and also leave the reflection until late enough that we had sufficient experiences to reflect on. Though this worked well for the reflection, the plan being left until so late in the week meant that we struggled to get input from all of the members in time, leading to a slight rush over the weekend.

Overall, although there were issues with our group organisation before and during the last week, we got iteration one done with no real struggles or challenges. Moving into iteration two, the main area we need to work on is our ability to sort things out far enough in advance.
